# FIFA 23 Penalty Kick Reinforcement Learning
Use Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning to train both *Goalkeeper* (GK) and *Striker* (ST) to be as good as possible by making them compete.

## Steps & Plans
### Preparing the Arena
- Setting up controllers with Python
- Define possible actions for GK & ST
- Build a CV model to create 'observations' (shared b/w GK & ST)

### Train the model
### Test & refine
